**SpendAuthSig** is a Schnorr based signature used in Zcash [Sapling](https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf) to sign transactions. This code can be used to protect private signing keys by distributing them among several parties, who upon request can run the threshold protocol to generate a signature.
